    "description": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, initiatives like CORD-19 have collected vast scientific literature on coronaviruses from repositories like PubMed Central, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. To manage this wealth of data effectively, we developed a biomedical named entity recognition (NER) system that identifies and normalizes drugs, diseases, genes, and proteins mentioned in texts using standardization systems like MeSH, ICD-10, ATC, SNOMED, ChEBI, GARD, and NCBI. Our BioNER+BioNEN system, trained on domain-specific datasets, processed the CORD-19 corpus, providing insights into coronavirus-related entities over the past fifty years.",

    "description": "Biomedical research relies on information retrieval tasks to keep pace with increasing publications. BioNER, aided by pretrained models like BioBERT, recognizes biomedical entities, linked to databases through BioNEN. Our system, based on BioBERT, achieves an F1-Score of 0.86 in PGxCorpus, applied practically in web platforms and CORD-19 analysis, despite minor boundary detection errors.",
